Github does not allow more than 200MB to be stored in the repo, so I had to store the files on my Google Drive.

1. Start by downloading the files from [Google Doc Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BmZGdt0cvE7mqM1Qky0Y0aCEEwDMECor?usp=sharing).
2. There is a file `db.sql` this is an exported postgres database that I generated by parsing the CSV files using python code and storing the data in a postgres database.
3. You should import the `db.sql` file into your locally installed Postgres server, then you can connect through Tableau.
